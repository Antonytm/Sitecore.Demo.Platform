#### How to Add a Career Page in the Experience Editor

Note: this is easiest to do from /sitecore/content/Habitat SXA Sites/{Your Site Name}/Home/Careers, but can technically be done from any page.

On the Home tab click on "Insert Page". In the content tree, navigate to the Careers landing page. Select the "Career Page" type, enter a name, and click "Ok". A new Career Page will appear in the Experience Editor, ready for editing.

#### How to Change the Job Type or Location on a Career Page in the Experience Editor

Open the Resources Page in the Experience Editor. Under the Experience Accelerator tab, click on "Other" in the Page Metadata section. From here, a different Job Type and/or Job Location can be selected. The page will need to be saved for the changes to take effect.
