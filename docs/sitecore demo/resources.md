# Resources Module

When creating a new Site, under Modules, be sure to select the following:

- Habitat Home XA Extensions
- Sitecore Demo Resources

Paths to relevant Landing Pages:

/sitecore/content/Habitat SXA Sites/{Your Site Name}/Home/Resources

#### How to Add a Tag and Resource Page in the Content Editor

1) Right click /sitecore/content/Habitat SXA Sites/{Your Site Name}/Data/Tags

2) Insert a new Tag.

3) Right click /sitecore/content/Habitat SXA Sites/{Your Site Name}/Home/Resources

4) Insert a new Resource. Fill out the relevant information under Content and Resource.

5) Scroll down to the Tagging section. The Tags field will show a treelist of all the tags. Pick whichever ones apply to the resource.

The Resources landing page can be filtered by the tags created in the Data folder.

#### How to Add a Resource Page in the Experience Editor

Note: this is easiest to do from /sitecore/content/Habitat SXA Sites/{Your Site Name}/Home/Resources, but can technically be done from any page.

On the Home tab click on "Insert Page". In the content tree, navigate to the Resources landing page. Select the "Resource Page" type, enter a name, and click "Ok". A new Resource Page will appear in the Experience Editor, ready for editing.

#### How to Change the Tags on a Resource Page in the Experience Editor

Open the Resources Page in the Experience Editor. Under the Experience Accelerator tab, click on "Tags". From here, tags can be applied or removed from the page. The page needs to be saved before the changes will appear under the Tags list.
